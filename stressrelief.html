    <h1>Welcome to Relaxation</h1>
    <h2>Dealing with schoolwork is hard, and we get that. Which is why we've created this website to help you take your mind off of grades and relax. Scroll through our library of soothing gifs or listen to some calming music to help you unwind. But most of all, enjoy yourself.</h2>
    <h3>Here are some quick tips for relieving stress:</h3>
    <h4>1. Yell "Haneul" loudly in a soothing and motherly way.</h4>
    <h4>2. Take long, deep breaths, and as you exhale, loosen your muscles. Repeat this until you feel loose and relaxed.</h4>
    <h4>3. Try to visualize a peaceful, happy scene like the beach or surround yourself with images of nature.</h4>
    <h4>4. Listen to music! Lift you spirits with some uplifiting music, or feel calm with some soothing instrumental music.</h4>

    <p>These are only four simple tips to relaxation. If you want to take your mind off grades and work for a bit, visit the separate tabs we have included for you.
