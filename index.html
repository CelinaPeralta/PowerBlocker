            <h2>ABOUT</h2>
            <h3>Hello! We are a group of asian youngsters who have basically no webdev experience. We went to hackBCA III in order to create something that will help others. And, so birthed our creation, <b>PowerBlocker</b>.<br><br>One of the main reasons for creating this extension is because stress can take over your life. Mental health is important, so staying rather stress-free is quite important. We hope that the development of this gadget will help students relax and take their mind off of schoolwork for a short period of time.</h3>

            <h2>What is PowerSchool?</h2>
            <h3>PowerSchool is an online website that many schools use across the country to keep track of a student's grades. The great thing about PowerSchool is that students, teachers, and parents alike can easily acess the pupil's grades and read teacher comments on how the student is performing in a matter of seconds. Although this may seem great, the downside to this is that students sometimes get caught of in their grades and only focus on their grades. By creating this website, we help students relax and relieve their stress.</h3>
